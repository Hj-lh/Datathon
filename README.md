# Spam and Ham Email Detection Project

## Overview

This project is developed as part of a datathon by our team, aimed at accurately detecting spam and ham (non-spam) emails. Utilizing machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we have designed a model that filters out unwanted emails, enhancing user productivity and security.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
